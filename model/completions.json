They hoped this would lead to more freedom among those enslaved but there wasn\u2019t enough money or manpower available on the island which meant no one really knew what happened inside these prisons because nobody ever saw anything other than men being beaten with sticks and clubs until death came upon them (see below).\n\n\nInmates are seen here working outside during daylight hours when most prisoners slept in darkness under bridges over water \u2013 not ideal conditions for rehabilitation!\n\n\nA group of inmates work together building a bridge across some small islands off shore - probably used as escape routes after dark! This particular prison has two wings separated by wooden partitions; presumably both housed different groups within each wing? A large stone wall surrounds the entire compound: perhaps part-timers living alongside staff members? There may have been separate cells attached to each wing where guards lived separately\u2026or maybe just"
