Small gaps were apparent under some of the tiles. Bat roosting potential considered borderline. Roosting potential considered negligible. A thorough and systematic search of all the flat surfaces and grounds within the internal spaces were searched to look for evidence of current or historic bat use and activity (e.g., droppings, discarded prey items) and none were found. No potential roost features present. Although minor potential roost features were identified, there was a lack of overall suitability of the roof spaces and a lack of evidence of bat activity or presence. Roosting potential was therefore considered negligible. The building had a slate roof which was in relatively good condition for the most part, with relatively few slipped or slightly lifted slates. These could conceivably provide access to bats. There was a clear gap here as the boarding did not sit flush against the stone. However, there were some ventilation holes located within the walls, which in theory could allow access for bats. Thorough inspection of the external features identified no bat droppings, or other such signs were identified anywhere around the building at all. To summarise, the building had numerous potential bat access points: beneath some lifted slates on the roof, especially those along the ridges for ventilation, and within the eaves of all along the building on the northern and southern aspects. No signs of bat activity were identified anywhere around the building. This was confirmed by the presence of a small concentrated scattering of bat droppings underneath the ridge clearly showing a place where small numbers of bats have previously roosted. Similarly, no signs of bat activity could be seen anywhere here. An inspection of the corrugated roof revealed a lack of suitability for bats due to a complete lack of access points. To summarise, the building had a number of potential bat access points. This comprised a small collection of droppings inside the building on the floor. The brick-built walls provide an ideal substate for bat activity to adhere to (e.g., droppings, discarded prey items), but no evidence was found. The roofs on top of the bay windows were in good condition with no gaps or missing tiles. Small gaps were apparent in gaps in the mortar. These gaps are large enough for bats and offer access into the internal space. Roosting potential borderline. A thorough and comprehensive search of the ground and flat surfaces around the building found no evidence of bat activity (e.g., discarded prey items, droppings) or presence. These were all thoroughly searched but no evidence was found. The roof was in good condition and had tightly interlocking slates and negligible possibility for bats was present around any flashings or fascias and soffits. Small gaps were identified under the tiles along the roof verge but a close-up thorough inspection from inside the loft found no evidence of bat activity or presence.

The walls on this structure were not sealed at all. There was extensive pointing missing around the stones. In addition, there were clear ventilation holes in the walls which opened up the possibility of bats flying directly into the structure and roosting inside. END This clearly resulted in many potential roost features inside the walls themselves all around the building. To summarise, the building had a number of potential bat access points. It was clear to see that bats could conceivably gain access to the inside of the building. The roof ridge was well sealed with no gaps beneath the ridge tiles and no PRFs or roosting potential. The roof pitches were in good condition with no apparent gaps, slipped cracked or missing tiles or other Potential Roost Features (PRFs) or significant opportunities for roosting or access to the internal space; a light moss covering across the north facing pitch effectively sealed any potential gaps."}

The roof comprised of interlocking tiles, which were generally well fitted. However, some gaps were present along the roof where the tiles were uneven and lifted. Overall, despite a thorough search no evidence of bats was found on the exterior of the building. The building had a slate roof which was in relatively good condition for the most part, with relatively few slipped or slightly lifted slate. END"}

{"prompt":"bat_droppings is none. building_type is barn. wall_material is brick. roof_form is pitched. roof_material is corrugated sheets. ->","completion":" The inspection began by checking the exterior of the building for signs of bats such as droppings, however none were discovered. Externally, the roof was found to be intact although there were gaps beneath tiles which offered roosting potential and access to the internal space. Numerous gaps were noted in the verges and the stonework on the shed that offered roosting potential and access to the internal space. They were constructed from red brick with overlapping tile on pitched roofs. The roofs were pitched and of overlapping asbestos cement tiles. Whilst the condition of the roofs was satisfactory, there were some gaps under the ridge tiles and some slipped tiles. The external walls of the two halls were examined and there was no indication of bat activity. A thorough and comprehensive search of the ground and flat surfaces around the halls found no evidence of bat activity. Overall, it was concluded that a number of the external aspects of the buildings which offered some roosting potential for bats, with gaps in the soffits and under the ridge tiles. The general condition of the building was good with no missing bricks or cracks in the sandstone or timber. The external walls were examined and no indication of bat activity. This was evident due to droppings at these gaps. A gap in the ceiling of one of these rooms suggested a potential access point. The barns were brick-built structures, with pitched roof covered with corrugated sheets. END"}
