No signs of bat activity were seen to be present. Based on a full search around the inside of the property, a lack of signs and suitable roosting locations, it was considered that the building had negligible bat roosting potential. END"}

Overall it was concluded that the building had negligible roosting potential. It was concluded that bats were not roosting in the building and no further surveys were required. The pitched roof of the house was constructed from interlocking roofing stone roofing tiles and was intact with no missing, slipped or cracked tiles. END"}
{"prompt":"potential is high. bat_droppings is found. bat_droppings is some. evidence is some. potential is some. ->","completion":" The roof void and the loft contained numerous Potential Roost Features and droppings which suggested that bats were used the space for roosting. No signs of bat activity were identified anywhere around the building. This was confirmed by the presence of a small concentrated scattering of bat droppings underneath the ridge clearly showing a place where small numbers of bats have previously roosted. END"}
