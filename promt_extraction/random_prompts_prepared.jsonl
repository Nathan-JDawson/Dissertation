Thorough inspection of the external features identified no bat droppings, or other such signs were identified anywhere around the building at all. To summarise, the building had numerous potential bat access points: beneath some lifted slates on the roof, especially those along the ridges for ventilation, and within the eaves of all along the building on the northern and southern aspects. No signs of bat activity were identified anywhere around the building. This was confirmed by the presence of a small concentrated scattering of bat droppings underneath the ridge clearly showing a place where small numbers of bats have previously roosted. Similarly, no signs of bat activity could be seen anywhere here. An inspection of the corrugated roof revealed a lack of suitability for bats due to a complete lack of access points. To summarise, the building had a number of potential bat access points. This comprised a small collection of droppings inside the building on the floor. The brick-built walls provide an ideal substate for bat activity to adhere to (e.g., droppings, discarded prey items), but no evidence was found. The roofs on top of the bay windows were in good condition with no gaps or missing tiles. Small gaps were apparent in gaps in the mortar. These gaps are large enough for bats and offer access into the internal space. Roosting potential borderline. A thorough and comprehensive search of the ground and flat surfaces around the building found no evidence of bat activity (e.g., discarded prey items, droppings) or presence. These were all thoroughly searched but no evidence was found. The roof was in good condition and had tightly interlocking slates and negligible possibility for bats was present around any flashings or fascias and soffits. Small gaps were identified under the tiles along the roof verge but a close-up thorough inspection from inside the loft found no evidence of bat activity or presence. Therefore, overall the building was considered to have negligible bat roosting potential. The pitched roof of the residential property was in very good condition, with very tight tiles and no cracked or missing tiles. END"}

{"prompt":"bat_droppings is none. roof_form is pitched. roof_condition is good. roof_material is slate tiles. roof_gaps is none. ->","completion":" The inspection began by checking the exterior of the building for signs of bats such as droppings, however none were discovered. Roosting potential was considered borderline. The main hipped roof was in good condition. Slates were tight fitting with no gaps, and the roof had some moss coverage which prevent bats from having any access. No evidence of potential roost features was identified. Small gaps were apparent under some of the tiles. Bat roosting potential considered borderline. Roosting potential considered negligible. A thorough and systematic search of all the flat surfaces and grounds within the internal spaces were searched to look for evidence of current or historic bat use and activity (e.g., droppings, discarded prey items) and none were found. No potential roost features present. Although minor potential roost features were identified, there was a lack of overall suitability of the roof spaces and a lack of evidence of bat activity or presence. Roosting potential was therefore considered negligible. The building had a slate roof which was in relatively good condition for the most part, with relatively few slipped or slightly lifted slates. These could conceivably provide access to bats. There was a clear gap here as the boarding did not sit flush against the stone. However, there were some ventilation holes located within the walls, which in theory could allow access for bats. Thorough inspection of the external features identified no bat droppings, or other such signs were identified anywhere around the building at all. To summarise, the building had numerous potential bat access points: beneath some lifted slates on the roof, especially those along the ridges for ventilation, and within the eaves of all along the building on the northern and southern aspects. No signs of bat activity were identified anywhere around the building. This was confirmed by the presence of a small concentrated scattering of bat droppings underneath the ridge clearly showing a place where small numbers of bats have previously roosted. Similarly, no signs of bat activity could be seen anywhere here. An inspection of the corrugated roof revealed a lack of suitability for bats due to a complete lack of access points. To summarise, the building had a number of potential bat access points. This comprised a small collection of droppings inside the building on the floor. The brick-built walls provide an ideal substate for bat activity to adhere to (e.g., droppings, discarded prey items), but no evidence was found. The roofs on top of the bay windows were in good condition with no gaps or missing tiles. Small gaps were apparent in gaps in the mortar. These gaps are large enough for bats and offer access into the internal space. Roosting potential borderline. A thorough and comprehensive search of the ground and flat surfaces around the building found no evidence of bat activity (e.g., discarded prey items, droppings) or presence. These were all thoroughly searched but no evidence was found. The roof was in good condition and had tightly interlocking slates and negligible possibility for bats was present around any flashings or fascias and soffits. Small gaps were identified under the tiles along the roof verge but a close-up thorough inspection from inside the loft found no evidence of bat activity or presence. Therefore, overall the building was considered to have negligible bat roosting potential. The pitched roof of the residential property was in very good condition, with very tight tiles and no cracked or missing tiles. END"}
